= AWS Backup

AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that centralizes data
protection across AWS services. AWS Backup supports the following
resources:

* xref:aws_elastic_compute_cloud.adoc[] instances
* xref:aws_simple_storage_service.adoc[] data
* xref:aws_elastic_block_store.adoc[] volumes
* xref:aws_dynamodb.adoc[] tables
* xref:amazon_relational_database_service.adoc[] databases.
* xref:amazon_aurora.adoc[] clusters
* xref:aws_elastic_file_system.adoc[] file systems
* Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems
* Amazon FSx for Window File Server file systems
* AWS Storage Gateway volumes
* Amazon DocumentDB clusters
* Amazon Neptune clusters

Concepts

* Vault: a container that stores and organizers backups. When creating a
backup vault, you must specify a xref:aws_key_management_system.adoc[KMS]
encryption key that encrypts some of the backups placed in this vault.
* Backup Plan: a policy expression that defines when and how you want to
back up AWS resources. AWS Backup stores periodic backups incrementally.
