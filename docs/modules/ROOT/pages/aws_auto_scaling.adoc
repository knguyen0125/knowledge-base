= AWS Auto Scaling

AWS Auto Scaling enables automatic scaling of scalable resources using xref:#_scaling_plan[], which uses dynamic scaling and predictive scaling to automatically scale application's resources.

AWS Auto Scaling is useful for applications that experience daily or weekly variations in traffic flow.

AWS Auto Scaling works with the following services:

* xref:aws_elastic_compute_cloud.adoc[] Auto Scaling Groups
* xref:aws_elastic_compute_cloud.adoc[] Spot Fleet
* xref:aws_elastic_container_service.adoc[]
* xref:aws_dynamodb.adoc[]
* xref:amazon_aurora.adoc[]

AWS Auto Scaling works with xref:#_dynamic_scaling[] and xref:#_predictive_scaling[]

[#_scaling_plan]
== Scaling Plan

Scaling plan is a set of instructions for scaling resources.

Scaling plan can scale based on:

* Availability: Maintain resource utilization at 40 percent
** Useful for urgent and unpredictable scaling needs
* Balanced between availability and cost: Maintain resource utilization at 50 percent
* Cost: Maintain resource utilization at 70 percent
* Via custom metrics and thresholds.

[#_dynamic_scaling]
== Dynamic Scaling

Dynamic Scaling creates a tracing scaling policies for the resources in xref:#_scaling_plan[]. The scaling policies adjust resource capacity in response to changes in resource utilization, with the intention to provide enough capacity to maintain utilization.

[#_predictive_scaling]
== Predictive Scaling

Predictive Scaling uses Machine Learning to analyze resource's historical workload and regularly forecasts the future load for the next two days.

Currently, only xref:aws_elastic_compute_cloud.adoc[EC2] Auto Scaling Group supports predictive scaling
