= Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse
service.

Concepts:

* Cluster: core infrastructure component of Amazon Redshift data
warehouse in a cluster. A cluster composed of one or more compute nodes.
If a cluster is provisioned with two ore more compute nodes, and
additional leader node coordinates the compute nodes.
* Database: A cluster contains one or more databases. User data is
stored in one or more compute nodes. The SQL client communicates with
the leader node, which in turns coordinate running queries with the
compute node.

== Amazon Redshift Spectrum

You can use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to query data in xref:aws_simple_storage_service.adoc[] files without having to load the data into Amazon
Redshift tables. The data can be registered with AWS Glue Data
Catalog and enabled with AWS Lake Formation and then be queried
with Redshift Spectrum.

== Redshift system architecture

=== Concepts

* Leader node: manages communication with client programs and all
communication with compute nodes. It parses and develops execution plan
to carry out database operations, in particular, series of steps
necessary to obtain results for complex queries.
** The leader node distributes SQL statements to compute nodes only when
a query references tables that are stored on the compute nodes. All
other queries run exclusively on leader node.
* Compute node: the leader node compiles code for individual elements of
execution plan and assigns code to individual compute nodes. The compute
nodes execute the compiled code and send intermediate results back to
leader node for final aggregation.
** Each compute node has its own dedicated CPU, memory and attached disk
storage. As workload grows, you can increase compute capacity and
storage capacity of a cluster by increasing number of ndoes, upgrade
node types, or both.
* Node slices: a compute node is partitioned into slices. Each slice is
allocated a portion of the nodeâ€™s memory and disk space, where it
processes a portion of the workload assigned to the node. The leader
node manages distributing data to the slices and apportion workload for
any queries or other database operations to the slices. The slices then
work in parallel to complete the operation.

==== Performance

* Redshift supports massively parallel processing, which enables fast
execution of most complex queries operating on large amounts of data.
Multiple compute nodes handle all query processing leading up to final
result aggregation, with each core of each node executing the same
compiled query segments on portion of the entire data.
* Columnar data storage: Columnar data storage reduces overall disk I/O
requirements and reduces the amount of data you need to load from disk.
* Data compression: Data compression reduces storage requirements,
reducing disk I/O, and improves query performance.
* Query optimizer: Redshift query execution engine incorporates a query
optimizer that is MPP-aware and also takes advantage of the
columnar-oriented data storage.
* Result caching: to reduce query execution time and improve system
performance, Redshift caches the results of certain types of queries in
memory on the leader node.
