= Elastic Fabric Adapter

An Elastic Fabric Adapter is a network device that you can attach to an xref:aws_elastic_compute_cloud.adoc[EC2] instance to accelerate High Performance Computing and Machine Learning applications.

Provides lower and more **consistent latency** and **higher throughput** than TCP. It achieves this by bypassing traditional TCP/IP stack and allow applications to communicate directly with the EFA. It also provide the traditional IP networking feature that are required to support xref:aws_virtual_private_cloud.adoc[VPC] networking as Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)

EFA use `libfabric` to bypass OS TCP/IP stack

Only some specific instance type and size support EFA, and the support varies between regions.
