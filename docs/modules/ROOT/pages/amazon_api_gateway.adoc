= Amazon API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that allows developers to
create REST-ful and WebSocket API. API Gateway handles all tasks
involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of
concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support,
authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API
version management.

Amazon API Gateway comes with 3 flavors:

* HTTP API: Low-latency, cost-effective integrations with AWS services
* REST API: More costly than HTTP APIs, but offers more features.
* WebSocket API: Supports 2 way communication between client apps and
backend.

Basically Amazon API Gateway provides a serverless API Gateway
offering that scales, but this seems to mostly works with xref:aws_lambda.adoc[] and xref:aws_dynamodb.adoc[].

Amazon API Gateway also integrates with xref:aws_web_application_firewall.adoc[]
