= AWS DirectConnect

AWS Direct Connect links internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over standard fiber-optic cable.
With the connection, you can create a *virtual interface* directly to public AWS services or to VPC

1Gbps and 10Gbps ports are available.
Support hosted connection of 1, 2, 5, or 10 Gbps.

Amazon Direct Connect also supports AWS Transit Gateway

Use cases:

* Transferring large data sets
* Developing and using applications that use real-time data feeds
* Building hybrid environments that satisfy requirements

== Setting up methods

|===
|Port speed |Method

|10 Gbps or higher
|Connect directly to AWS device from router

|1 Gbps or higher
|Work with partner

|Less than 1 Gbps
|Work with partner to create a hosted connection
|===

To access public resources in a remote region, you must set up a public virtual interface and establish a Border Gateway Protocol session

To provide failover, request and configure 2 dedicated connections to AWS.
These connections can terminate on one or 2 routers on network.
Configuration choices:

* Active/Active (BRP multipath): Default configuration, where both connections are active
* Active/Passive (failover): One connection is handling traffic, the other is on standby

Autonomous System numbers (ASN): Identify networks that presents a clearly defined external routing policy to the internet

== Cross connects

* After you downloaded your Letter of Authorization and Connecting Facility Assignment (LOA-CFA), you must complete your cross-network connection (known as cross connect)

== Virtual interfaces

* You can configure multiple virtual interfaces on a single AWS Direct Connect connection (one private virtual interface for each VPC, or use AWS Direct Connect gateway)
* Prerequisites
** Connection: Direct Connect connection or link aggregation group
** Virtual interface name
** Virtual interface owner
** VLAN: Unique VLAN tag that is not already in use for connection
** Address family (IPv4 or v6)
** Peer IP address: A virtual interface can support a BGP peering session for IPv4, IPv6 or dual-stack.
Cannot create multiple BGP peering session for the same IP addressing family
** BGP information: Public or private BGP ASN for your side of BGP session, and an MD5 BGP authentication key
* MTU of a virtual private interface can either be 1500 or 9001 (jumbo frames).
MTU of transit virtual interface for VPC Transit Gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways can be either 1500 or 8500 (Jumbo frames).
Public virtual interface doesnâ€™t support jumbo frames
* Jumbo frames are supported on virtual private interfaces attached to virtual private gateway or a Direct Connect gateway.
Jumbo frames apply only to propagated routes from Direct Connect.

== Link Aggregation Group

* A logical interface that uses Link Aggregation Protocol to aggregate multiple connections at a single Direct Connect endpoint, allowing you to treat them as a single, managed connection.
* All connections in the LAG must use the same bandwidth
* You can have a maximum of 4 connections in a LAG.
* All connections in the LAG must terminate at the same Direct Connect endpoint
* All connections in a LAG operate in Active/Active mode
* In only available for dedicated 1G or 10G connections

== Direct Connect Gateways

* Use Direct Connect Gateway to connect your Direct Connect connection over private virtual interface to one or more VPCs in your account that are located in same or different Regions
* Globally available resource
* You can associate up to 10 VPCs from multiple accounts with a Direct Connect gateway.
All VPCs must be owned by the same AWS account
