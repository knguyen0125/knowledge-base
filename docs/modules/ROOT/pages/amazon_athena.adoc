= Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that makes it easy to
analyze data directly from xref:aws_simple_storage_service.adoc[S3] using
standard SQL. Under the hood, Athena uses xref:presto.adoc[].

Athena integrates directly with xref:amazon_quicksight.adoc[]
for easy data visualization. Athena also integrates with [[Glue Data
Catalog]] to create tables and query data in Athena based on a central
metadata store.

Athena supports a wide variety of data formats such as CSV, JSON, ORC,
Avro or Parquet.

Athena supports partitioning to reduce amount of data scanned by each
query, improving performance and reduce cost.
