= AWS Transit Gateway

AWS Transit Gateway connects xref:aws_virtual_private_cloud.adoc[]s and on-premise networks through a central hub, replacing complex VPC peering relationships.
AWS Transit Gateway reduces complexity in a multi-account environment where multiple xref:aws_virtual_private_cloud.adoc[]s connect together.

AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager can be used to provide a single, global view of private network to help reduce complexity of managing a global network across AWS and on-premise.

== Concepts

* Attachments: AWS Transit Gateway can be attached to the following
** One or more xref:aws_virtual_private_cloud.adoc[]s
** A Connect third-party virtual appliance (such as SD-WAN appliance)
** An xref:aws_directconnect.adoc[] gateway
** A peering connection with another AWS Transit Gateway
** A xref:aws_site_to_site_vpn.adoc[] connection to a transit gateway
* Transit gateway Maximum Transmission Unit: Transit gateway supports an MTU of 8500 bytes for most traffic, and 1500 for traffic over xref:aws_site_to_site_vpn.adoc[] connection
* Transit gateway Route Table: A transit gateway has a default route table and optionally additional route tables.
A route table includes dynamic and static routes.
* Association: Each attachment is associated with exactly one route table
* Route propagation: A xref:aws_virtual_private_cloud.adoc[], xref:aws_site_to_site_vpn.adoc[] connection or xref:aws_directconnect.adoc[] gateway can dynamically propagate routes to a transit gateway route table.
