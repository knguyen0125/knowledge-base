= Amazon Kinesis

Amazon Kinesis make it easy to collect, process and analyze
real-time, Streaming Data.

Amazon Kinesis provides the following capabilities:

* Kinesis Video Streams: Stream video from connected devices to AWS
services such as Amazon Rekognition or Amazon SageMaker
* xref:#_kinesis_data_streams[]: Stream data that can continuously capture
gigabytes of data per second to Kinesis Data Analytics, Apache
Spark on xref:amazon_elastic_mapreduce.adoc[], xref:aws_elastic_compute_cloud.adoc[] or xref:aws_lambda.adoc[Lambda]
* xref:#_kinesis_data_firehose[]: Capture, transform and load data streams
into AWS Data stores such as xref:aws_simple_storage_service.adoc[S3], xref:amazon_redshift.adoc[Amazon
Redshift], or Amazon OpenSearch Service for near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools
* Kinesis Data Analytics: Process data streams in real-time with
SQL or Apache Flink

[#_kinesis_data_firehose]
== Kinesis Data Firehose

Kinesis Data Firehose is a ETL service that reliably captures,
transform and deliver streaming data into data lake, data stores and
analytics services.

Kinesis Data Firehose can stream data into xref:aws_simple_storage_service.adoc[S3], xref:amazon_redshift.adoc[Amazon Redshift], Amazon OpenSearch Service or Splunk using delivery stream. Before delivery, data is
typically buffered and can optionally be transformed, either using
built-in transformation or xref:aws_lambda.adoc[Lambda].

[#_kinesis_data_streams]
== Kinesis Data Streams

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a Serverless data service that
makes it easy to capture, process and store data streams.

Kinesis Data Streams use cases includes:

* Stream log and event data, from service logs, clickstream data, sensor
data, etc. to generate metrics
* Build applications for high frequency event data
* Power event-driven applications (as substitutes for Amazon Simple
Queue Service|SQS)

Common use case of Kinesis Data Streams is real-time aggregation of
data and loading the aggregate data into a data warehouse or
xref:amazon_elastic_mapreduce.adoc[] cluster. Multiple applications can consume
data from a stream, so that multiple actions such as archiving and
processing can take place concurrently and independently. (Similar to
xref:apache_kafka.adoc[Apache Kafka])

One stream consists of one or more Kinesis Data Streams
shard|shards, which is a uniquely identified sequence of data records.
Each shard can support up to 5 TPS for read with maximum data read rate
of 2 MB per second and up to 1000 records per second for writes, up to
maximum total data write rate of 1 MB per second. Data is grouped within
a stream using partition key.

Kinesis Data Streams can be used in both on-demand mode, or
provisioned mode.
