= AWS Nitro Enclaves

AWS Nitro Enclaves is an xref:aws_elastic_compute_cloud.adoc[] feature that allows customers to create isolated execution environments (enclaves) from EC2 instance to perform compute on sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information.

Nitro Enclaves only provide secure local socket connectivity between the enclaves and its parent instance, with no persistent storage, external networking or interactive access.
Users cannot SSH into the enclave, and data and applications within the enclave cannot be accessed from parent instance.

Nitro Enclave supports attestation feature, which allows the enclaveâ€™s identity and only authorized code is running inside it.

CPU and Memory is isolated from parent instance and other instances by splitting the CPU and memory from parent instance and create another virtual machine

Nitro Enclaves are only supported Nitro-based instances with at least 4 vCPUs, and is running in Linux operating system only

== Connecting to Enclave

When running AWS Nitro Enclaves, a `vSock` socket is created between the enclave and parent instance.
Enclaves can only communicate with parent instance via this socket.
