= Amazon Simple Notification Service

AWS SNS is a managed service that provides message delivery from
publishers to subscribers. Publishers communicate asynchronously with
subscribers by sending messages to a topic. Subscribers can subscribe to
SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint
type, such as AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, SQS, Lambda, HTTP, email,
mobile push notifications, mobile text messages.

Common AWS SNS scenarios includes:

* Application integration / Fanout scenario: A message is pushed to an
SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints. This allows
for parallel asynchronous processing.
* Application alerts: SNS can send application and system alerts to SMS
or email
* User notifications: SNS can push email messages or text messages (SMS)
to individuals or groups
* Mobile push notifications: Allows sending messages directly to mobile
apps.

== Event sources and destinations

=== Event sources

Apart from sending events/messages directly to SNS topic, SNS is also
integrated with multiple AWS services:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-event-sources.html[Amazon
SNS event sources - Amazon Simple Notification Service]

=== Event destinations

* Application to Application destinations:
** Kinesis Data Firehose: Deliver events to stream for archiving and
analysis purposes. Through this, you can deliver events to AWS
destinations like S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch Service, or third-party
destinations
** xref:aws_lambda.adoc[]
** xref:aws_simple_queue_service.adoc[]
** Event Fork Pipelines: Deliver events to event backup and storage,
event search and analytics, etc.
*** This seems to be a legacy feature as SNS now recomend using Kinesis
Data Firehose for this
** HTTP/S: Deliver events to external webhooks
* Application to Person destinations
** SMS
** Email
** Platform endpoints/ Mobile push notifications
** AWS Chatbot
** PagerDuty

== Standard vs FIFO topics

FIFO topics allows customers to build applications that require messages
to be sent and processed in a strict sequence and without duplicates

The only destination allowed for FIFO SNS topics is FIFO SQS queues

|===
| |Standard |FIFO

|Message Order |Best effort |FIFO
|Delivery |At least once |Exactly once, with message deduplication
|Transaction per second |Nearly unlimited |300 TPS
|===

FIFO message ordering:

* SNS FIFO delivers messages to SQS FIFO in exact order that the message
are published to the topic. With SQS FIFO, consumers receive the message
in exact order that messages are sent to queue.
** Each subscriber is perceived differently
** When SQS FIFO queue subscriber becomes unreachable, the ordering can
get out of sync.

FIFO Message Grouping:

* Messages that belong to the same group are processed one by one, in
strict order relative to the group.

FIFO Message deduplicating: When publishing to SNS FIFO topic, message
must include deduplication ID. Any messages with the same deduplication
ID, within 5 minute interval, is accepted but not delivered.

* If message body is guaranteed to be unique for each published message,
you can enable content-based deduplication. SNS automatically generate
an unique hash for each message, so no deduplcation ID is needed.

== Message durability

Messages are replicated across multiple AZ, and provide dead-letter
queues to handle exceptional cases. Message delivery fails when SNS
topic can’t access a subscribed SQS queue due to client-side or server
side error. SNS will retry for server-side error, for up to 29 days. SNS
will NOT retry for client-side error.

== Message filtering

By default, SNS topic subscriber receives every message published to
topic. To receive a subset of messages, a subscriber must assign a
filter policy to topic subscription. Thi scan simplify use of SNS by
consolidating message filtering criteria into topic subscription.

SNS have a quota of ~100 filter policies per account per region, and
this limit can be increased. However, it doesn’t seem like we can
increase this too much, so filter policy should be applied judiciously.

== Security

SNS can enable both encryption at rest (with server-side encryption -
SSE) and encryption in transit using TLS. SSE encrypts message as soon
as SNS receives them, and SNS decrypts messages only when they are sent.

=== Identity and Access Management

In addition to using IAM roles and permissions, SNS has its own
resource-based permissions that uses policy. You can use this access
policy to grant access to another AWS account; limits subscription
protocol, or allowing SNS to publish messages to SQS queue
