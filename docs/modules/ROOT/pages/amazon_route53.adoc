= Amazon Route53

Amazon Route 53 is a highly available DNS service.
You can use Route 53 for the following functionalities

* Register domain names
* Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain
* Check the health of resources

== Concepts

=== Domain Registration Concepts

* Domain Name
* Domain Registrar: A company accredited by ICANN to process domain registrations for specific TLDs
** For example, Amazon Registrar can process domain registration for .com, .net, .org
* Domain registry: A company that own the right to sell domains that have a specific TLD.
** For example, VeriSign owns the right to sell domains that have a .com TLD
* Domain reseller: Company that sells domain name for registrars
* Top-level domain
** Generic TLD
** Geographic TLDs

=== DNS concepts

* Alias record: A Type of record that you can create with Route 53 to route traffic to AWS resources
* Authoritative Name Server: A name server that has definite information about one part of the DNS and that responds to requests from a DNS resolvers by returning the applicable information.
** Route 53 name servers are authoritative name servers for every domain that uses Route 53 as the DNS service.
Name server knows how you want to route traffic for your domain and subdomains based on records that created in hosted zone
* DNS Query
* DNS Resolver: Resolver communicates with DNS name servers to get the IP address for the corresponding resource such as a webserver.
** Also known as a recursive name server because it sends requests to a sequence of authoritative DNS name servers until it gets the response.
* Hosted Zone: A container for records which include information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and all of its subdomains.
** Public hosted zone: Route internet traffic to resoruces
** Private hosted zone: Route traffic within the VPC
* Name servers: Servers in DNS that help to translate domain names into IP addresses that computer uses to communicate with one another
* Private DNS: Local version of DNS that lets you route traffic for a domain and its subdomain to EC2 instances within one or more VPCs
* Records: Object in hosted zone that you use to define how you want to route traffic for the domain or subdomain
* Reusable delegation set: A set of 4 authoritative name servers that you can use with more than one hosted zone.
By default, Route 53 assigns a random selection of name servers to each new hosted zone.
* Routing policy: Settings for records that determine how Route 53 responds to queries
** Simple routing policy
** Failover routing policy
** Geolocation routing policy
** Geoproximity routing policy
** Latency routing policy
** Multivalue answer routing policy
** Weighted routing policy
* TTL: Amount of time in seconds that you want DNS resolver to cache the values for a record

=== Health checking concepts

* DNS failover: Routing traffic away from unhealthy resources and to healthy resources
* Endpoint: the resource that you configure a health check to monitor the health of
* Health check: A Route 53 component that monitor an endpoint is healthy, can notify when it is not and can configure DNS failover

== Using Route 53 as DNS

=== Type of records

[width="100%",cols="2",options="header",]
|===
|Type of record |Description
|NS (Name Server) |Specifies which name servers are authoritative for a
domain or a subdomain

|SOA (Start of Authority) |Stores information about domains and is used
to direct how a DNS zone propagates to secondary name servers

|A |Used to map a domain name to IPv4 address

|AAAA |Used to map a domain name to IPv6 address

|CNAME (Canonical Name) |Alias that points to another domain or
subdomain, but never an IP address

|MX (Mail Exchange) |Map where to deliver email for a domain

|TXT |Allows adding limited human and machine-readable notes that can be
used for things such as email validation, site, ownership, etc.

|SRV (Service) |Allows services such as VoIP to be directed to a
separatate host and port location

|SPF (Sender policy framework) |Helps prevent email spoofing and limits
spammer

|PRT (Pointer) |Reverse A and AAAA records, map IP addresses to Domain
Name. Can’t exist in the same zone as other DNS record types

|Alias Records |Route 53-specific extension to DNS, allows routing
traffic to selected AWS resources
|===

=== Routing policy

[width="100%",cols="3",options="header",]
|===
|Routing policy |Description |Public or Private
|Simple |No special Route 53 routing Can specify multiple values in a
record |Private and Public

|Failover |Route traffic to a resource when resource is healthy or a
different resource when first resource is unhealthy. |Private and public

|Multivalue Answer |Configure multiple value. |Private and public

|Weighted |Associate multiple resources with a single domain name or
subdomain name. |Private and public

|Geolocation |Lets you choose the resources that serve traffic based on
geographic location of users. |Public only

|Geoproximity |Route traffic based on location of resources and shift
traffic from resources in one location to resources in another |Public
only

|Latency-based |Serve requests from AWS Region that provide lowest
latency |Public Only
|===

=== Latency vs Geolocation vs Geoproximity

[width="100%",cols="4",options="header",]
|===
| |Latency |Geoproximity |Geolocation

|Definition
|Route 53 serve user requests from AWS Region that provides
the lowest latency. Based on latency measurements performed over a
period of time, and measurements reflect changes in network connectivity
and routing
|Route traffic based on geographic location of users and
resources Can optionally choose to route more or less traffic by a bias
which shrinks or expands the size of geographic region
|Serve traffic
based on geographic location of users

|How it works
|Create latency records for resources in multiple AWS
regions. When Route 53 receives a DNS query, it determines which AWS
Regions that created latency records for, determine which gives lowest
latency and select a latency record in that region
|Use Route 53 Traffic
Flow. Create traffic flow policy for resource with one of these values
With AWS resource: Set the AWS Region where resource is created Non-AWS
Resource: Latitude and longitude of resource
|Mapping IP addresses to
locations. Can create a default record that handle queries from IP
address that aren’t mapped

|Resource in multiple AWS regions
|Route traffic based on location of
resources
|Route traffic based on location of users (localize content,
restrict distributions, etc.)

== Using Route 53 Health Checks

Route 53 health checks monitor the health and performance of applications and other resources

Types of Route 53 health checks:

* Monitor and endpoint: Monitor and endpoint that is either IP address or domain name.
* Monitor other health check (calculated health checks): Monitor whether Route 53 heal checks.
* Useful when multiple resources are performing the same function, and chief concern is whether some minimum number of resources are healthy
* Monitor CloudWatch alarms
* Application Recovery Controller

DNS Failover

* Active-Active failover: Route 53 exclude resources that is unhealthy.
* Can be configured with any routing policy
* Active-Passive failover: Route 53 includes only healthy primary resources.
If all primary resources are unhealthy, Route 53 begins to include only healthy secondary resources
* Can be configured only using failover routing policy

== Amazon Route53 Resolver

Route53 Resolver is automatically created with VPC to answer DNS queries for local VPC domain names and records in private hosted zones.
For all other domain names, Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers.

Resolvers additionally contains endpoints to answer DNS queries to and from your networks, which is any network that is reachable from your VPC.

=== Route 53 Resolver endpoints

Inbound endpoint: DNS Resolvers on network can forward DNS queries to Route 53 Resolver via this endpoint

Outbound endpoint: Resolver conditionally forwards queries to resolver on your network via this endpoint.
