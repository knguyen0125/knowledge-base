AWS CloudTrail is AWS service that logs actions taken by user, role or
AWS service

Terminologies

* CloudTrail event: Record of an activity in an AWS account
** Management events: Information about control-plane (management)
operations performed on resources in AWS account. For example,
configuring security; registering devices; setup logging, etc.
*** Management events are logged by default
** Data events: Information about data-plane (resource) operations.
These include object-level API (PutObject, etc.) xref:aws_dynamodb.adoc[] events, etc.
*** Data plane events are *NOT logged by default*
** Insight events: Capture unusual activity in AWS account. CloudTrail
detects unusual activity, log to a different prefix on S3 bucket for
trail.
*** Insight events are only logged when CloudTrail detects API usage
that differ significantly from accountâ€™s typical usage pattern.
* CloudTrail event history: CloudTrail provide viewable, searchable and
downloadable record for 90 days.
* Trail: A configuration that enables delivery of CloudTrail events to
S3 bucket, Cloudwatch Logs and CloudWatch events.
* *Organization Trail*: Configuration that enables delivery of
CloudTrail events in management account and all member accounts to same
xref:aws_simple_storage_service.adoc[] bucket, xref:amazon_cloudwatch.adoc[] logs and
xref:amazon_cloudwatch.adoc[] events.
* Global service events: For most services, events are recorded in
region where the action occurred. For global services (xref:aws_identity_and_access_management.adoc[IAM]), events are delivered to any trail that includes
global services.
** For most global services, events are logged to US East (N. Virginia)
region, but some are logged to US East (Ohio) or US West (Oregon) region
** User can enable global service events for single region trail
** By default, single region trail have global service event logging
turn off; all regions trail have global service event turn on by
default.
** To turn on or off global service, user need to enable it in CLI
* Regional vs All Region trail: A trail can log events in a single
region, or for all regions.
** Trails are only viewable in AWS regions where they log events
* Events are not delivered in real-time, but on average about 15 minutes
of an API call.
